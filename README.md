 - *Don't you already have another Hovertank 3D clone on your Github?*

Indeed I do, it can be viewed [here](https://github.com/eg0nSpengler/UnityTank3D)

When I decided to create a clone of Hovertank, I originally began creating it using UE4 but after [countless](https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/a5ptrc/why_is_the_ue4_documentation_lacking_the_same/) [headaches](https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/c2lzw8/when_will_epic_update_reference_documentation_to/) and [endless](https://forums.unrealengine.com/unreal-engine/announcements-and-releases/1739154-changes-to-the-official-unreal-engine-wiki) [nights](https://forums.unrealengine.com/development-discussion/c-gameplay-programming/1460337-delegate-invocation-list-changes-inside-a-constructor-does-not-propagate-to-a-derived-blueprint) [of](https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/d863jd/how_to_avoid_ue4_intellisense_bugs/) [frustration](https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/gls89l/problem_with_intellisense_in_ue_425vs2019/), I switched over to Unity and my iteration speed was increased tenfold.

I love and appreciate both Unreal and Unity but for now, I've decided to place this on hold.
